# Reinforcement Learning for Connect 4

Optimizing Connect 4 gameplay using **Deep Reinforcement Learning** and **Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS)**.

##  Project Overview

This project develops a deep reinforcement learning (RL) agent that masters the classic Connect 4 game by combining:
- Deep neural networks (CNN-based)
- Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS)
- Self-play reinforcement learning

##  Why Connect 4?

Connect 4 is an ideal RL benchmark:
- Simple rules, yet complex strategy.
- Fully observable and deterministic environment.
- Ideal for validating RL and symbolic AI methods.

##  Methodology

- **Environment:** Custom Python implementation of Connect 4.
- **Neural Network:** CNN predicts action probabilities (policy) and game outcome (value).
- **Algorithm:** AlphaZero-style self-play combined with MCTS.
